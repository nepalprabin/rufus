        "Text Summarization NLP \u2013 Prabin Nepal\nWhat is text summarization?\nText summarization is one of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks where documents/texts are shortened automatically while holding the same semantic meaning. Summarization process generates short, fluent and accurate summary of the long documents. The main idea of text summarization is to find the subset of the most important information from the entire document and present it in a human readable format. Text summarization has its application in other NLP tasks such as Question Answering (QA), Text Classification, Text Generation and other fields.\nTypes of summarization\nBased on how the texts are extracted from the documents, the summarization process can be divided into two types: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization.\nExtractive Summarization\nExtractive summarization picks up the most important sentences directly from the documents and forms a coherent summary. This is done using a scoring function. Extractive summarization takes a sentence as an input and produces a probability vector as the output. This probability vector represents the probability of a sentence being included in the summary.\nImplementing extractive summarization based on word frequency\nWe can implement extractive summarization using word frequency in five simple steps:\na. Creating word frequency table\nWe count the frequency of the words present in the text and create a frequency table which is a dictionary to store the count. While creating the frequency table, we do not account for the stop words present in the text and remove those words.\ndef\nfrequency_table(text):\n# all unique stopwords of english\nstop_words\n=\nset\n(stopwords.words(\n\"english\"\n))\nwords\n=\nword_tokenize(text)\nfreq_table\n=\ndict\n()\n# creating frequency table to keep the count of each word\nfor\nword\nin\nwords:\nword\n=\nword.lower()\nif\nword\nin\nstop_words:\ncontinue\nif\nword\nin\nfreq_table:\nfreq_table[word]\n+=\n1\nelse\n:\nfreq_table[word]\n=\n1\nreturn\nfreq_table\nb. Tokenizing the sentences\nHere we tokenize the sentences using NLTK\u2019s sent_tokenize() method. This separates paragraphs into individual sentences.\ndef\ntokenize_sentence(text):\nreturn\nsent_tokenize(text)\nc.\u00a0Scoring the sentences using term frequency\nHere, we score a sentence by its words, by adding frequency of every word present in the sentence excluding stop words. One downside of this approach is, if the sentence is long, the value of frequency increases.\ndef\nterm_frequency_score(sentence, freq_table):\n# dictionary to keep the score\nsentence_value\n=\ndict\n()\nfor\nsentence\nin\nsentences:\nfor\nword, freq\nin\nfreq_table.items():\nif\nword\nin\nsentence.lower():\nif\nsentence\nin\nsentence_value:\nsentence_value[sentence]\n+=\nfreq\nelse\n:\nsentence_value[sentence]\n=\nfreq\nreturn\nsentence_value\nd.\u00a0Finding the threshold score\nAfter calculating the term frequency, we calculate the threshold score.\ndef\ncalculate_average_score(sentence_value):\n# To compare the sentences within the text, we assign a score.\nsum_values\n=\n0\nfor\nsentence\nin\nsentence_value:\nsum_values\n+=\nsentence_value[sentence]\n# Calculating average score of the sentence. This average score can be a good threshold.\naverage\n=\nint\n(sum_values\n/\nlen\n(sentence_value))\nreturn\naverage\ne. Generating the summary based on the threshold value\nBased on the threshold value, we generate the summary of the text.\ndef\ncreate_summary(sentences, sentence_value, threshold):\n# Applying the threshold value and storing sentences in an order into the summary.\nsummary\n=\n''\nfor\nsentence\nin\nsentences:\nif\n(sentence\nin\nsentence_value)\nand\n(sentence_value[sentence]\n>\n(\n1.2\n*\nthreshold)):\nsummary\n+=\n\" \"\n+\nsentence\nreturn\nsummary\nAbstractive Summarization\nIn abstractive summarization, the model forms its own phrases and sentences to provide a consistent summary. Abstractive summarization does not simply copy the sentences to form the summary but create new phrases that are relevant to the original document. This summarization technique uses deep learning techniques (like seq2seq) to paraphrase and shorten the original document.\nAbstractive Summarization using Transformers\nTransformers is an architecture which uses attention mechanisms to solve sequence to sequence problems while solving long term dependencies. Ever since it was introduced in 2017, transformers have been widely used in various NLP tasks such as text generation, question answering, text classification, language translation and so on. The transformer architecture consists of encoder and decoder parts. The encoder component consists of 6 encoders each of which consists of two sub layers: self-attention and feed forward networks. The input text is first converted into vectors using text embedding methods. Then the vector is passed into the self attention layer and the output from the self attention layer is passed through the feed forward network. The decoder also consists of both self attention and feed forward network layer. An additional layer is present in between these components which is an attention layer that helps the decoder to focus on the relevant parts of the input sentence.\nFig. Transformer architecture (from original paper)\nHuggingface Transformers provide various pre-trained models to perform NLP tasks. It provides APIs and tools to download and train state-of-the-art pre-trained models. Not only NLP, huggingface supports Computer Vision tasks like image classification, object detection and segmentation, audio classification and recognition, and multimodal tasks like table question answering, optical character recognition, and many more.\nBasic transformer pipeline for summarization\nHuggingface transformers provide an easy to use model for inference using pipeline. These pipelines are the objects that hide complex code and provide a simple API to perform various tasks.\nfrom\ntransformers\nimport\npipeline\nclassifier\n=\npipeline(\n\"summarization\"\n)\ntext\n=\n\"\"\"Acnesol Gel is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. It is used to treat acne, which appears as spots or pimples on your face, chest or back. This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin.  Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment. Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\"\"\"\nclassifier(text)\nResult:\n[{\n'summary_text'\n:\n' Acnesol Gel is an antibiotic that fights bacteria that causes pimples .

Different architectures like GTP, T5, BART are used to perform summarization tasks. We will be using the PubMed dataset. It contains datasets of long and structured documents obtained from PubMed OpenAccess repositories. from datasets import load_dataset\npubmed\n=\nload_dataset(\n\"ccdv/pubmed-summarization\"\n)\nThe PubMed dataset contains article, abstract and section_names as columns. The first step after loading the dataset is tokenizing the training data. Tokenization is the process of splitting paragraphs, sentences into smaller units called tokens. tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u2018facebook/bart-large-cnn\u2019)\nThe next step is to preprocess the data. Before training the data, we need to convert our data into expected model input format.\ndef\npreprocess_function(examples):\ninputs\n=\n[doc\nfor\ndoc\nin\nexamples[\n\"article\"\n]]\nmodel_inputs\n=\ntokenizer(inputs, max_length\n=\n1024\n, truncation\n=\nTrue\n)\nlabels\n=\ntokenizer(examples[\n\"abstract\"\n], max_length\n=\n128\n, truncation\n=\nTrue\n, padding\n=\nTrue\n)\nmodel_inputs[\n\"labels\"\n]\n=\nlabels[\n\"input_ids\"\n]\nreturn\nmodel_inputs\nWe need to apply the processing function over the entire dataset. Setting flag\nbatched=True\nhelps to speed up the processing of multiple elements of the dataset at once.\ntokenized_pubmed\n=\npubmed.\nmap\n(preprocess_function, batched\n=\nTrue\n)\nNext, we need to create a batch for all the examples. Huggingface provides a data collator to create a batch for the examples.\ntokenized_datasets\n=\ntokenized_pubmed.remove_columns(pubmed[\n\"train\"\n].column_names)\ndata_collator\n=\nDataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer\n=\ntokenizer, model\n=\n\"facebook/bart-large-cnn\"\n)\nHuggingface provides various pre-trained models that we can leverage to perform a variety of machine learning tasks.\nmodel\n=\nAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model)\nBefore training the model, we need to define our training hyperparamaters using training arguments. Since text summarization is a sequence to sequence tasks, we are using Seq2SeqTrainingArguments. And, we need to define our trainer by passing training and test dataset along with training arguments.\n# training arguments\ntraining_arguments\n=\nSeq2SeqTrainingArguments(\noutput_dir\n=\n'./results'\n,\nevaluation_strategy\n=\n'epoch'\n,\nlearning_rate\n=\n2e-5\n,\nper_device_train_batch_size\n=\n8\n,\nper_device_eval_batch_size\n=\n8\n,\nweight_decay\n=\n0.01\n,\nsave_total_limit\n=\n3\n,\nnum_train_epochs\n=\n3\n,\n# remove_unused_columns=False,\n# fp16=True,\n)\ntrainer\n=\nSeq2SeqTrainer(\nmodel\n=\nmodel,\nargs\n=\ntraining_arguments,\ntrain_dataset\n=\ntokenized_pubmed[\n'train'\n],\neval_dataset\n=\ntokenized_pubmed[\n'validation'\n],\ntokenizer\n=\ntokenizer,\ndata_collator\n=\ndata_collator\n)\nThe last step is to call\ntrain()\nto fine-tune our model.\ntrainer.train()\nConclusion\nSummarization helps to generalize the long documents by paraphrasing the important sentences from the whole document. It is very helpful in various applications like summarizing legal contracts, medical documents, news information and many more."

        "Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax - GitHub Docs\nSkip to main content\nUnderstanding GitHub Code Search syntax\nYou can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.\nIn this article\nAbout code search query structure\nThe search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see\nAbout searching on GitHub\nand\nSearching on GitHub\n.\nSearch queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.\nA bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.\nFor example, the following query:\nhttp-push\nThe above query will match the file\ndocs/http-push.txt\n, even if it doesn't contain the term\nhttp-push\n. It will also match a file called\nexample.txt\nif it contains the term\nhttp-push\n.\nYou can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.\nFor example, the following query:\nsparse index\nThe search results would include all documents containing both the terms\nsparse\nand\nindex\n, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing\nSparseIndexVector\n, a file with the phrase\nindex for sparse trees\n, and even a file named\nindex.txt\nthat contains the term\nsparse\n.\nSearching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search\nhello AND world\n. Other boolean operations, such as\nhello OR world\n, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see\nUsing boolean operations\n.\nCode search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see\nQuery for an exact match\n.\nYou can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as\nrepo:\n,\nlanguage:\nand\npath:\n. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see\nUsing qualifiers\n.\nYou can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see\nUsing regular expressions\n.\nQuery for an exact match\nTo search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:\n\"sparse index\"\nYou can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:\npath:git language:\"protocol buffers\"\nSearching for quotes and backslashes\nTo search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string\nname = \"tensorflow\"\n, you can search:\n\"name = \\\"tensorflow\\\"\"\nTo search for code containing a backslash,\n\\\n, use a double backslash,\n\\\\\n.\nThe two escape sequences\n\\\\\nand\n\\\"\ncan be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either\n\"\nor\n\\\nis included in the search, unchanged.\nAdditional escape sequences, such as\n\\n\nto match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See\nUsing regular expressions\n.\nUsing boolean operations\nCode search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators\nAND\n,\nOR\n, and\nNOT\nto combine search terms.\nBy default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the\nAND\noperator. For example, the search query\nsparse index\nis the same as\nsparse AND index\n, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms\nsparse\nand\nindex\n, in any order.\nTo search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the\nOR\noperator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either\nsparse\nor\nindex\n:\nsparse OR index\nTo exclude files from your search results, you can use the\nNOT\noperator. For example, to exclude files in the\n__testing__\ndirectory, you can search:\n\"fatal error\" NOT path:__testing__\nYou can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:\n(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:\"/tests/\"\nUsing qualifiers\nYou can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.\nRepository qualifier\nOrganization and user qualifiers\nLanguage qualifier\nPath qualifier\nSymbol qualifier\nContent qualifier\nIs qualifier\nRepository qualifier\nTo search within a repository, use the\nrepo:\nqualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:\nrepo:github-linguist/linguist\nTo search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple\nrepo:\nqualifiers with the boolean operator\nOR\n. For example:\nrepo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter\nNote\nCode search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the\nrepo:\nqualifier to work.\nOrganization and user qualifiers\nTo search for files within an organization, use the\norg:\nqualifier. For example:\norg:github\nTo search for files within a personal account, use the\nuser:\nqualifier. For example:\nuser:octocat\nNote\nCode search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.\nLanguage qualifier\nTo narrow down to a specific languages, use the\nlanguage:\nqualifier. For example:\nlanguage:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp\nFor a complete list of supported language names, see\nlanguages.yaml\nin\ngithub-linguist/linguist\n. If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.\nPath qualifier\nTo search within file paths, use the\npath:\nqualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term\nunit_tests\nin their path, use:\npath:unit_tests\nThe above query will match both\nsrc/unit_tests/my_test.py\nand\nsrc/docs/unit_tests.md\nsince they both contain\nunit_test\nsomewhere in their path.\nTo match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:\npath:/(^|\\/)README\\.md$/\nNote that the\n.\nin the filename is escaped, since\n.\nhas special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see\nUsing regular expressions\n.\nYou can also use some limited glob expressions in the\npath:\nqualifier.\nFor example, to search for files with the extension\ntxt\n, you can use:\npath:*.txt\nTo search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:\npath:src/*.js\nBy default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like\napp/src/main.js\n. But if you prefix the expression with\n/\n, it will anchor to the start. For example:\npath:/src/*.js\nNote that\n*\ndoesn't match the\n/\ncharacter, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the\nsrc\ndirectory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as\n/src/app/testing/utils/example.js\n, you can use\n**\n. For example:\npath:/src/**/*.js\nYou can also use the\n?\nglobal character. For example, to match the path\nfile.aac\nor\nfile.abc\n, you can use:\npath:*.a?c\nTo search for a filename which contains a special character like `*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:\npath:\"file?\"\nGlob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string\nfile?\n.\nSymbol qualifier\nYou can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the\nsymbol:\nqualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source\nTree-sitter\nparser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.\nFor example, to search for a symbol called\nWithContext\n:\nlanguage:go symbol:WithContext\nIn some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method\ndeleteRows\non a struct\nMaint\n, you could search\nsymbol:Maint.deleteRows\nif you are using Go, or\nsymbol:Maint::deleteRows\nin Rust.\nYou can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the\nString\ntype:\nlanguage:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/\nNote that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:\nBash\nC\nC#\nC++\nCodeQL\nElixir\nGo\nJSX\nJava\nJavaScript\nLua\nPHP\nProtocol Buffers\nPython\nR\nRuby\nRust\nScala\nStarlark\nSwift\nTypescript\nWe are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source\nTree-sitter\nparser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.\nContent qualifier\nBy default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the\ncontent:\nqualifier. For example:\ncontent:README.md\nThis query would only match files containing the term\nREADME.md\n, rather than matching files named\nREADME.md\n.\nIs qualifier\nTo filter based on repository properties, you can use the\nis:\nqualifier.\nis:\nsupports the following values:\narchived\n: restricts the search to archived repositories.\nfork\n: restricts the search to forked repositories.\nvendored\n: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.\ngenerated\n: restricts the search to content detected as generated.\nFor example:\npath:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived\nNote that the\nis:\nqualifier can be inverted with the\nNOT\noperator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:\nlog4j NOT is:archived\nTo exclude forks from your results, you can search:\nlog4j NOT is:fork\nUsing regular expressions\nCode search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.\nFor example, to search for the regular expression\nsparse.*index\n, you would use:\n/sparse.*index/\nNote that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the\nApp/src\ndirectory, you would use:\n/^App\\/src\\//\nInside a regular expression,\n\\n\nstands for a newline character,\n\\t\nstands for a tab, and\n\\x{hhhh}\ncan be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.\nMost common regular expressions features work in code search. However, \"look-around\" assertions are not supported.\nSeparating search terms\nAll parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords\nAND\n,\nOR\n, and\nNOT\n, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses,\n(\n)\n, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.\nIf your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:\nprintf(\"hello world\\n\");\nCode search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.\nIf code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.\nCase sensitivity\nBy default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string \"True\", you would use:\n/(?-i)True/"

        "Augmenting Large Language Models: Expanding Context and Enhancing Relevance \u2013 Prabin Nepal\nWith the rise of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs), the potential for AI to surpass human capabilities has become a topic of both fascination and concern. While LLMs excel at understanding language, following instructions, and reasoning, they often fall short when it comes to performing specific tasks. Simply inputting a prompt into ChatGPT may result in answers that are unrelated or out of context, a phenomenon known as \u201challucination.\u201d To obtain relevant information, it is crucial to provide the model with the appropriate context. However, the size of the context window is limited, posing a challenge in capturing all necessary information. Although the context size has increased over time, storing extensive information within a fixed context window remains impractical and expensive. This is where the augmentation of language models comes into play.\nAugmenting large language models involves three primary approaches:\nretrieval,\nchains, and\ntools.\nThese methods aim to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by providing them with additional resources and functionalities.\nRetrieval Augmentation:\nRetrieval augmentation involves leveraging an external corpus of data for the language model to search through. Traditionally, retrieval algorithms employ queries to rank relevant objects in a collection, which can include images, texts, documents, or other types of data. To enable efficient searching, the documents and their corresponding features are organized within an index. This index maps each feature to the documents containing it, facilitating quick retrieval. Boolean search determines the relevance of documents based on the query, while ranking is typically performed using algorithms like BM25 (Best Match 25).\nBM25 (Best Match 25) is a ranking function commonly used in information retrieval to measure the relevance of a document to a given query. It is a probabilistic retrieval model that enhances the vector space model by incorporating document length normalization and term frequency saturation.\nIn BM25, the indexing process involves tokenizing each document in the collection into terms and calculating term statistics such as document frequency (df) and inverse document frequency (idf). Document frequency represents the number of documents in the collection containing a particular term, while inverse document frequency measures the rarity of the term across the collection.\nDuring the querying phase, the query is tokenized into terms, and term statistics, including query term frequency (qtf) and query term inverse document frequency (qidf), are computed. These statistics capture the occurrence and relevance of terms in the query.\nWhile traditional retrieval methods primarily rely on keyword matching and statistical techniques, modern approaches leverage AI-centric retrieval methods that utilize embeddings. These methods offer improved search capabilities and help retrieve contextually relevant information.\nChains\nChains involve using the output of one language model as the input for another. By cascading multiple models together, the output of each model becomes the input for the subsequent one. This chaining process allows the models to build upon each other\u2019s knowledge and reasoning abilities, potentially leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\nThe sequential arrangement of models in a chain creates a pipeline of of interconnected language models, where the output of one model serves as the input for the next. This pipeline allows for a cascading flow of information and reasoning, enabling the models to collectively enhance their understanding and generate more accurate responses. By leveraging a chain of language models, each model can contribute its specialized knowledge and capabilities to the overall task. For example, one model may excel at language comprehension, while another may possess domain-specific knowledge.\nAs the input passes through the chain, each model can refine and expand upon the information, leading to a more comprehensive and contextually relevant output. The chaining process in language models has the potential to address the limitations of individual models, such as hallucination or generating irrelevant responses. By combining the strengths of multiple models, the pipeline can help mitigate these issues and produce more reliable and accurate results.\nFurthermore, the pipeline can be customized and tailored to specific use cases or tasks. Different models can be integrated into the chain based on their strengths and compatibility with the desired objectives. This flexibility allows for the creation of powerful and specialized systems that leverage the collective intelligence of multiple language models.\nLangchain\nLangchain\nhas emerged as an immensely popular tool for constructing chains of language models, making it one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in this domain. With support for both Python and JavaScript, it provides a versatile platform for building applications and can be seamlessly integrated into production environments. Langchain serves as the fastest way to kickstart development and offers a wide range of pre-built chains tailored for various tasks. Many developers find inspiration from Langchain and end up creating their own customized chaining solutions. One of the key strengths of Lang chain lies in its extensive repository, which houses numerous examples of different chaining patterns. These examples not only facilitate idea generation but also serve as valuable resources for learning and gaining insights into effective chaining techniques. Whether for rapid prototyping or constructing production-grade systems, Lang chain strikes a balance between ease of use and flexibility, empowering developers to effortlessly create their own chaining systems when needed.\nThe building block of Langchain are chains. Chains can be simple/generic or specialized. One simple chain is a generic chain that contains a single LLM. Generic chain takes a prompt and uses LLM for text generation based on the prompt. Let\u2019s see how to achieve a simple chain using OpenAI\u2019s gpt-3.5 turbo model.\nimport\nos\nos.environ[\n\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n]\n=\n\"...\"\nfrom\nlangchain.prompts\nimport\nPromptTemplate\ntemplate\n=\n\"\"\"\nWho won the oscar for the best actor in  a leading role on\n{year}\n?\n\"\"\"\nprompt\n=\nPromptTemplate(\ninput_variables\n=\n[\n\"year\"\n],\ntemplate\n=\ntemplate,\n)\nprint\n(prompt.\nformat\n(year\n=\n2012\n))\nOutput: Who won the oscar\nfor\nthe best actor\nin\na leading role on\n2012\n?\nPromptTemplate\nhelps to design prompt for your tasks and you can provide input variables if you want like below:\ntemplate\n=\n\"\"\"\nWho won the oscar for the best\n{role}\non\n{year}\n?\n\"\"\"\nWhile creating a prompt template for multiple variables, you need to pass all those variables in\ninput_variables\nargument\nprompt\n=\nPromptTemplate(\ninput_variables\n=\n[\n\"role\"\n,\n\"year\"\n],\ntemplate\n=\ntemplate,\n)\nTools\nThe another way to give LLMs access to outside world is to let them use tools.\nUsing Tools in Langchain\nTools are the flexible way to augment language model with external data. There are two ways to build tools into language models. First way is to manually create chains whereas the later one is the use of plugins and letting the model figure it out. Some example tools that can be use includes Arxiv, Bash, Bing Search, Google, etc.\nTools can be used in langchain using following code snippet (in Python):\nfrom\nlangchain.agents\nimport\nload_tools\ntool_names\n=\n[...]\ntools\n=\nload_tools(tool_names)\ntools\nYou can name the tools that you are going to use and load them using load_tools methods\nLet\u2019s use Python\u2019s requests module as a tool to extract data from the web\nfrom\nlangchain.agents\nimport\nload_tools\ntool_names\n=\n[\n'requests_all'\n]\nrequests_tools\n=\nload_tools(tool_names)\nrequests_tools\nOutput:\n[\nRequestsGetTool(name\n=\n'requests_get'\n, description\n=\n'A portal to the internet.

Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n# Create a CodeAgent with DuckDuckGo search capability\nfrom\nsmolagents\nimport\nCodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel\nagent\n=\nCodeAgent(\ntools\n=\n[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],\n# Add search tool here\nmodel\n=\nHfApiModel(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n)\n# Add model here\n)\nIn this snippet, we initialize a CodeAgent with the DuckDuckGoSearchTool, allowing the agent to perform web searches to answer queries.\nSet Up a Multi-Agent System with Manager and Web Search Agents\nMulti-Agent systems are the agents that are specialized on complex tasks with more scalable and robust nature. In\nsmolagents\n, various agents can be integrated to produce Python code, invoke external tools, conduct web searches, and more. By coordinating these agents, it\u2019s possible to develop robust workflows. A typical multi-agent system includes:\n- A manager Agent\n- A code interpreter Agent\n- A web Search Agent\nMulti-agent system allows to separate memories between different sub-tasks and provide great benefits. Firstly, each agent are more focused on its core taks and secondly, separating memories reduces the count of input tokens resulting in reducing latency and cost. Below is the multi-agent system when\nweb_agent\nperforms search and\nmanager_agent\ngives data analysis capabilities. Also, we can import dependencies (like python libraries) that helps to perform the tasks.\nfrom\nsmolagents\nimport\nCodeAgent, ToolCallingAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel, VisitWebpageTool\nweb_agent\n=\nToolCallingAgent(\ntools\n=\n[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), VisitWebpageTool()],\nmodel\n=\nHfApiModel(model_id\n=\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n),\nmax_steps\n=\n10\n,\nname\n=\n\"search\"\n,\ndescription\n=\n\"Agent to perform web searches and visit webpages.\"\n)\nmanager_agent\n=\nCodeAgent(\nmodel\n=\nHfApiModel(model_id\n=\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n),\nmanaged_agents\n=\n[web_agent],\nadditional_authorized_imports\n=\n[\n\"pandas\"\n,\n\"time\"\n,\n\"numpy\"\n]\n# Corrected imports\n)\nConfigure Agent Security Settings\nSecurity is a crucial aspect when deploying AI agents, especially when they execute code. Below code snippet uses E2B to run code in a sandboxed environment. It is a remote execution that run the code in a isolated container.\nfrom\nsmolagents\nimport\nCodeAgent, HfApiModel\nfrom\nsmolagents.sandbox\nimport\nE2BSandbox\nmodel\n=\nHfApiModel(\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n)\nagent\n=\nCodeAgent(\ntools\n=\n[],\nmodel\n=\nmodel,\nsandbox\n=\nE2BSandbox(),\n# Configure the sandbox\nadditional_authorized_imports\n=\n[\n\"numpy\"\n],\n# Authorize numpy import\n)\nImplement a Tool-Calling Agent\nSimilar to\nCodeAgent\n,\nToolCallingAgent\nis another type of agent available in smolagent library. CodeAgent uses Python code snippets whereas ToolCallingAgent use built-in tool-calling capabilities of LLM providers and generate JSON structures.\nfrom\nsmolagents\nimport\nToolCallingAgent, HfApiModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool\nagent\n=\nToolCallingAgent(\ntools\n=\n[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],\nmodel\n=\nHfApiModel(model_id\n=\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n),\nname\n=\n\"SearchAgent\"\n,\ndescription\n=\n\"An agent that uses DuckDuckGo to search the web.\"\n,\nmax_steps\n=\n5\n,\n)\nSet Up Model Integration\nLLM models are the most important aspect when creating AI agents. There are many model availables for various tasks and domains. So we can easily integrate models that is required for our task. Below code snippet switches between two different models providers.\nfrom\nsmolagents\nimport\nHfApiModel, LiteLLMModel\n# Initialize Hugging Face model\nhf_model\n=\nHfApiModel(model_id\n=\n\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\"\n)\n# Initialize LiteLLM model as an alternative model\nother_model\n=\nLiteLLMModel(model_id\n=\n\"anthropic/claude-3-sonnet\"\n)\n# Set the model to hf_model or alternative model\nmodel\n=\nhf_model\n# Alternatively, you can switch this to `other_model`"

I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.\nDan Godfrey\nDevelopment Manager\nFlexible project planning for developers\nGet started\nContact sales\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is GitHub Issues?\nWe all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it\u2019s built-in to every repository. GitHub\u2019s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.\nWith GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.\nWe built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.\nWhat are Projects?\nAs teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.\nThe new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.\nCan I update existing Projects to use the new capabilities?\nYes. You can migrate your existing Projects (classic) to the new GitHub Projects through a new feature preview.\nHow it works:\nWe\u2019ll create a new project and copy all of the data from your existing project (classic) board to the new one.\nOnce the data is copied, you can use the new project with all the new capabilities.\nOnce the new project is ready, we will prompt you to close your \u201cold\u201d project, as the old project is not kept in sync.\nWhat plans have access to Projects?\nAll users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.\nHistorical charts are available for all Enterprise organizations and are currently in Preview for organizations on Team plans.**\n**Subject to change as we add future capabilities.\nWill the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?\nYes! GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support follows our regular cadence of one to two quarters before enabling the on-premises functionality.\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time."

        "Projects \u2013 Prabin Nepal\n1.\nStanford NLP Lecture Transcription using OpenAI\u2019s Whisper\nWhisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model trained on hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data. It is implemented as an encoder-decoder transformer architecture where audio are splitted into 30 seconds of chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. The decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps, multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speech translation. For more info about whisper, read\nhere\n.\nI used whisper model to transcribe Stanford NLP lectures into corresponding text captions.\nHere\nis the result of the transcribed lectures. This web app is build using Flask and deployed on AWS EC2 instance. You can find transcribed audio file in the form of text\nhere\n.\n2.\nCustom Named Entity Recognizer for clinical data\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities in text.\nI have developed a custom named entity recognition (NER) model for clinical data using the spacy framework and deployed it using Streamlit. The model is capable of identifying various entities such as diseases, treatments, medications, and anatomical locations from clinical text data. The model classifies entities based on three classes:\n\u2018MEDICINE\u2019\n,\n\u201cMEDICALCONDITION\u201d\n, and\n\u201cPATHOGEN\u201d\n. The dataset was used from\nkaggle\n. You can try the application on this\nlink\n3.\nQuestion Answering using Langchain and OpenAI\nThis application provides a simple example of how to build a question-answering system using Langchain and pre-trained language models from OpenAI and Streamlit.\nLangchain helps to build Large Language Models (LLMs) through composability. It helps to combine large language models with other sources of computation.\nI developed a question answering system using Langchain with OpenAI embeddings. Since, LLMs tends to have fixed context length, Langchain helps to eliminate this issue by introducing chains, where we can break the document into different chunks and run the chain on the whole document. In this application, when a user uploads a file, the contents are converted into embeddings using OpenAI embeddings and stored in Pinecone vector database. Storing embeddings this way, helps for faster retrieval of the embeddings. When a user enters the query, similarity search is conducted to retrieve the similar embeddings from the vector store and the langchain chain passes the formatted response to the LLM."

        "Brief overview of GPT-4 \u2013 Prabin Nepal\nSince the release of ChatGPT, there has been significant interest and discussion within the broader AI and natural language processing communities regarding its capabilities. In addition to this, ChatGPT has captured the attention of the internet at large due to its remarkable ability to generate fluent and natural-sounding responses across a wide range of prompts and language tasks. Due to this, it became fastest growing consumer application in the history, just two months after the launch. ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series and can write articles, jokes, poetrys in response to the prompt. Though powerful, there have also been concerns raised about the potential risks associated with it and other large language models (LLMs), particularly with respect to issues such as bias, and misinformation. One of the major concern for LLMs is that it suffers from\nhallucination\n.\nHallucination refers to the phenomenon where the model generates responses that are not supported by the input or are inconsistent with reality. This can happen when the model generates text that appears to be coherent and relevant, but is not grounded in any factual or contextual information.\nA year after releasing ChatGPT, OpenAI released GPT-4 (on 14th March, an improved version of GPT-3.5 model that supports multimodal data. It is capable of processing text and image data to generate textual data. It achieved human level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. On a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieved a score that falls on the top 10% of the exam takes. In contrast, the score achieved by previous model GPT-3.5 fell on bottom 10%. This shows the level of improvement achieved by the latest version of GPT. It is also important to mention that the model was not specifically trained on these exams. A minority of problems were seen by model while training.\nCapabilities of GPT-4\nThough the report does not provide any details about architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, or training method, a demo run by\nGreg Brockman\n(President and Co-founder, OpenAI) after the release of GPT-4 shows various capabilities of the model.\nYou can watch the GPT-4 Developer Livestream replay here:\n1. Supports longer context\nGPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, that enables its usage in situations that require the creation of lengthy content, extended dialogues, or the exploration and analysis of extensive documents.\n2. Hand-drawn pencil drawing turned into a fully functional website\nGPT-4 is also capable of handling visual input, such as hand-drawn pencil drawings that looks like a mock design, and generating code to create a website. The generated output is mind blowing. Another important aspect is the accuracy by which the model is able to perform OCR task with such messy handwritings.\nFig. Left is the mock design and right is the website created using the code generated from gpt4-model.\nsource\n3. GPT-4 can describe the image.\nAs opposed to text on prompts (on previous GPT version), this model accepts inputs containing both text and images. It lets user specify any language or vision tasks. GPT-4 displays comparable skills on various types of content, such as documents containing both textual and visual elements like photographs, diagrams, or screenshots, as it does when dealing with text-only inputs.\nExample prompt demonstrating GPT-4\u2019s visual input capability. The prompt consists of a question about an image with multiple panels which GPT-4 is able to answer.\nsource\n4. Human level performance on professional and academic benchmarks\nGPT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models on various standardized exams, such as GRE, SAT, BAR, and APs, along with other research benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSWAG, and TextQA. GPT-4 outperforms the English language performance of GPT 3.5 and existing language models (\nChinchilla\nand\nPaLM\n), including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili.\nLimitations of GPT-4\nThough there has been a tremendous improvement as compared to previous models, GPT-4 has similar limitations as earlier GPT models. It is not fully reliable and hallucinates.\nSince GPT-4 is trained on the data available till September 2021, it lacks knowledge of the events occured after that time period.\nRisks and mitigations\nThe prompts entered by the users are not always safe. When providing unsafe inputs to the model, it may generate undesirable text like commiting crimes. To mitigate these risks, various approaches like Adversarial Testing, Model Assisted Safety Pipeline are carried out. Using domain experts and their findings, model is improved to refuse request for unsafe inputs like synthesizing dangerous chemicals.\nExamples of how unsafe inputs are refused by the model\nConclusion\nThe recent advancements in GPT-4, have proven to outperform existing language models in a collection of NLP tasks. The improved capabilities of GPT-4 are not limited to the English language, as predictable scaling allows for accurate predictions in many different languages. However, the increased capabilities of GPT-4 also present new risks, which require significant work to understand and improve its safety and alignment. Nevertheless, GPT-4 marks a significant milestone towards the development of broadly useful and safely deployed AI systems.\nReferences:\nGPT-4 Technical Report\nGPT-4 Blog Post\nchat.openai.com\nPS\nWhile GPT-4 may have stolen the headlines, it was not the only new technology on display. AnthropicAI unveiled\nClaude\n, next gen AI assistant can help with use cases including summarization, search, creative and collaborative writing, Q&A, coding, and more. Meanwhile, Google AI released\nPaLM\n, an entry point for Google\u2019s large language models with variety of applications. With these three new systems, the future of AI looks brighter than ever before."
